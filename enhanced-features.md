## Technical Implementation Details

### AI Service Architecture
```typescript
interface AIRecipeService {
  generateRecipesByIngredients(
    ingredients: string[],
    dietaryRestrictions: DietaryRestriction[],
    preferences: UserPreferences
  ): Promise<RecipeSuggestion[]>;
  
  generateRecipeVariations(
    foodName: string,
    dietaryRestrictions: DietaryRestriction[],
    culturalPreferences: string[]
  ): Promise<RecipeVariation[]>;
  
  analyzeNutritionalContent(
    recipe: Recipe,
    servingSize: number
  ): Promise<NutritionalAnalysis>;
  
  suggestIngredientSubstitutions(
    ingredient: string,
    dietaryRestrictions: DietaryRestriction[],
    recipeContext: string
  ): Promise<IngredientSubstitution[]>;
}
```

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- User dietary profiles
CREATE TABLE dietary_profiles (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT UNIQUE,
  allergies TEXT[], -- JSON array
  dietary_preferences TEXT[], -- JSON array
  health_conditions TEXT[], -- JSON array
  nutritional_goals TEXT, -- JSON object
  created_at DATETIME,
  updated_at DATETIME
);

-- Recipe nutritional information
CREATE TABLE recipe_nutrition (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  recipe_id INTEGER,
  serving_size INTEGER,
  calories INTEGER,
  protein REAL,
  carbohydrates REAL,
  fat REAL,
  fiber REAL,
  sugar REAL,
  sodium REAL,
  vitamins TEXT, -- JSON object
  minerals TEXT, -- JSON object
  FOREIGN KEY (recipe_id) REFERENCES recipes(id)
);

-- Ingredient substitutions cache
CREATE TABLE ingredient_substitutions (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  original_ingredient TEXT,
  substitute_ingredient TEXT,
  dietary_restriction TEXT,
  substitution_ratio REAL,
  flavor_impact TEXT,
  texture_impact TEXT,
